# DataPoisoning-Label-flipping-
Detecting and preventing data poisoning in fraud detection using Label Flipping Attack defense.

#  Fraud Detection Vulnerabilities

->Data Poisoning Threat
Fraud detection models are exposed to data poisoning, leading to misclassification.
->Misclassification Impact
Increased fraudulent transactions are incorrectly classified as legitimate, worsening fraud cases.
->Label Flipping Attack
Implementing a label flipping attack on the fraud detection dataset to evaluate vulnerabilities.
->Detection Mechanism Development
Developing mechanisms to detect and identify poisoned data within the dataset.


#  Fraud Detection & Data Poisoning Defense  

**Detecting & Preventing Label Flipping Attack in Credit Card Fraud Detection**

##  Project Overview  
Machine learning models, especially in **fraud detection**, are vulnerable to **data poisoning attacks**. This project focuses on **Label Flipping Attack**, where **fraudulent transactions are incorrectly labeled as non-fraudulent**, reducing the model‚Äôs ability to detect fraud.  

** Objectives:  
- Simulate a **Label Flipping Attack** in a fraud detection dataset.  
- Implement **anomaly detection (Isolation Forest)** to flag poisoned samples.  
- Develop a **correction mechanism** to restore mislabeled fraud cases.  
- Train a **robust fraud detection model** and compare its performance **before and after defense**.
